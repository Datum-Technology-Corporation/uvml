# About
The Moore.io UVM Extensions Library is *the* must-have library in all your digital design simulations.  This project consists of the library (`uvml_pkg`), the self-testing agent (`uvma_st_pkg`), the self-testing UVM environment (`uvme_st_pkg`) and the test bench (`uvmt_st_pkg`) to verify the library against itself.
